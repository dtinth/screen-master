# screen-master

A presentation tool for hackers. Create live presentation with live data (e.g.
scoreboard, names, etc.) using React and cast it to a projector screen.

## Workflow

- You write the code to determine how things will be displayed on a projector
  screen using React and JSX.

- The rendered screen is sent to the projector through Firebase.

- This means we can customize the code and change everything on the screen
  without needing to refresh the page on the projector.
